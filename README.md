## 🔄 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - Load Airbnb dataset using pandas
   - Preview data types, missing values, and structure

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values, drop duplicates
   - Format columns (price, dates, etc.)

3. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Distribution of price, reviews, room types
   - Histogram and boxplot analysis

4. **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis**
   - Price vs. Room Type
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Availability by location

5. **Insights**
   - Top neighborhoods by listing volume
   - Average pricing by room/property type
   - Host analysis (e.g., most listings)

## 📈 Visual Highlights

- 📊 Bar plots of property types
- 📍 Geographic distribution of listings
- 🧠 Correlation heatmaps for numeric fields
- 📌 Price distribution by city and room type

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Entire homes/apartments** dominate Airbnb listings
- **Chicago** has a higher average price than New Orleans
- **Superhosts** typically offer more affordable stays with better ratings
- Price is influenced by both **location** and **room type**
